## [Unreleased] - yyyy-mm-dd

## [1.8.0] - tbd

**Notifications Update**

> ⚠️ **Important update notes:** This update will remove configured notification types from all webhooks and thereby effectively suspend notification sending. Please make sure to go through all your webhooks and re-configure the notification types to re-enable sending after updating.

### Added

- Notification for wars

- Direct link to open Structures Auth page from every notification message

### Changed

- Messages now originate from an app name instead of the organization a notification belongs to. The organization now appears as author on messages.

- Improved notification architecture to make it easier for adding new notification types
- Moved utils into it's own distribution package: allianceauth-app-utils

## [1.7.0] - 2021-01-10

**Localization**

### Important notes for upgrading

#### Required manual steps

If you are upgrading you need to perform the following manual steps to get the new localizations:

Please make sure to be in your venv and in the folder where `manage.py` is located (e.g. `/home/allianceserver/myauth`). Then run the following commands one by one:

Upgrade to the new version:

```bash
pip install -U aa-structures
```

Run migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

Copy static files:

```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```

Restart your supervisors:

```bash
supervisorctl restart myauth:
```

Update the local copy of your Eve Online universe data to get localizations:

```bash
python manage.py structures_updatesde
```

#### Task priorities

This new version makes use of "task priorities" to ensure important tasks like the delivery of attack notifications are executed as quickly as possible.

For this to work please also make sure you have celery task priorities activated. This was a new feature introduced with Alliance Auth 2.6.3 and required some additional [manual configuration](https://gitlab.com/allianceauth/allianceauth/-/merge_requests/1181#note_317289062) of your local `celery.py` file.

#### Preferred language

Finally you may want to set your preferred language. Please see [Localization](https://gitlab.com/ErikKalkoken/aa-structures#localization) in the README for details.

### Added

- Localization for Chinese, English and German
- Notification related tasks now use priorities to ensure faster delivery ([#17](https://gitlab.com/ErikKalkoken/aa-structures/issues/17))
- List of supported notifications added to README

### Changed

- Changed admin functions from celery tasks to commands: update_sde, purge_all
- Now shows separate status for structure sync, notification sync, forwarding sync on admin site for each owner
- Removed official support for Python 3.5, but will technically still work

### Fixed

- Notifications are now correctly send to multiple webhooks on the same owner ([#19](https://gitlab.com/ErikKalkoken/aa-structures/issues/19))
- Attempt to reduce the current memory leak in celery workers ([#18](https://gitlab.com/ErikKalkoken/aa-structures/issues/18))

## [1.0.0] - 2020-02-12

**Starbases and Sovereignty**

### Important notes for upgrading

If you are upgrading: there are some important changes included in this release, which may require you to take action. Please read the notes carefully.

#### Starbase feature requires token update

The new starbases feature requires additional ESI scopes to work. After installation of this release all structure owners therefore have to update their tokens by adding themselves again via "Add Structure Owner". Syncing of structures and notifications for a corporation will stop working until the respective owner has updated its token.

The starbase feature is turned on by default. If you don't want to use this feature (or enable it later) you can turn it off with this new setting:

```python
STRUCTURES_FEATURE_STARBASES = False
```

#### SDE data update

We have extended the SDE models and therefore need you to do a one-time update of the  local SDE data. This update must be performed AFTER the new migrations have completed and AA has been restarted.

You can start the SDE data update with the following command (assuming the name of your AA project is "myauth"). Please make sure to run this command from the folder where `manage.py` is located in.

```bash
celery -A myauth call structures.tasks.run_sde_update
```

This process can take a while to complete. Until then some features like category filtering and planet detection for customs offices will not work correctly.

#### New notifications

To enable the new notifications for starbases and sovereignty you wil need to manually activate them on any already existing webhook.

For sov notifications you also need to nominate one owner as "alliance main" on the admin panel. Sov notifications will then be forwarded from this owner.

#### Most features now turned on by default

With release 1.0.0 most features are turned on by default and you need to explicitly turn them off if you don't want to use them - or just want to activate them later. Please see section **Changed** for details.

### Added

- Starbases added to the structure browser
- You can now receive Starbase notifications
- You can now receive Sovereignty notifications
- It is now possible to filter by category (orbital, structure, starbase) and group (e.g. Engineering Complex) in the structures browser
- Ability to deactivate syncing for an owner
- Admin tool for purging all data to enable de-installation

### Changed

- POCO feature is not turned on by default! If you don't want to use it (or enable it later) you can disable it with a setting.
- Moon mining extraction timers are now turned on by default! If you don't want to use it (or enable it later) you can disable it with a setting.
- For starbases and POCOs the name of the related celestial (e.g. planet, moon) is now shown on the structure browser under location.
- Improved admin site views to include more information, filters and a search bar

## [0.9.1] - 2020-02-01
