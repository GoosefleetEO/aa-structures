## Code Formatting

This repository uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to
verify compliance with formatting rules.

To use run the following commands inside your virtual environment:

1. Install the tool with `pip install pre-commit`.
1. Then from inside the root directory of your local repo, run `pre-commit install`.
1. You're all done! Code will now be checked automatically using git hooks.

You can also run `pre-commit run --all` to manually run all checks.
